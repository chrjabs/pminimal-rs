# Scuttle - A Multi-Objective MaxSAT Solver in Rust

Scuttle is a multi-objective MaxSAT solver written in Rust and based on the
[RustSAT](https://github.com/chrjabs/rustsat) library and the
[CaDiCaL](https://github.com/arminbiere/cadical) SAT solver.

## Publications

This solver was used in our CP'23 paper on preprocessing for multi-objective
optimization \[5\] and our CPAIOR'24 paper on core boosting \[6\].
Additional material for the CP'23 paper can be found
[here](https://bitbucket.org/coreo-group/mo-prepro) while material for the
CPAIOR'24 paper is available in the `cpaior24/` directory in this repository.

## Algorithms

| `--algorithm=`   | Description                                                               |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `p-minimal`      | P-Minimal model enumeration as described in \[1\] and \[2\]               |
| `lower-bounding` | Lower-bounding search as described in \[3\] (called "core-guiding" there) |
| `bioptsat`       | Sat-Unsat variant of the BiOptSat algorithm described in \[4\]            |

## Building

If you simply want a binary of the solver, you can install it from
[crates.io](https://crates.io) by running `cargo install scuttle`.

To build the project from source, make sure to initialize the git submodules
with `git submodule update --init`. You can then build `scuttle` by running
`cargo build`.

## What's The Name

[Apparently](https://crabbingzone.com/what-is-group-of-crabs-called/) "scuttle"
is one of multiple term for a group of crabs, which seemed fitting for a
_multi_-objective solver in _Rust_.
